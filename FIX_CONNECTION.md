# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix for MySQL Connection Error

## The Problem
You're getting: "MySQL server has gone away" error when trying to login.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Stop Your App
Press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where the app is running.

### Step 2: Make Sure Laragon MySQL is Running
1. Open **Laragon**
2. Make sure MySQL is **green** (running)
3. If not, click **"Start"** button

### Step 3: Restart Your App
```cmd
python start_fast.py
```

### Step 4: Try Login Again
Go to http://localhost:5000 and try logging in.

## If Still Failing

The connection pool settings in `config.py` should help. But if it still fails, try:

1. **Restart Laragon MySQL:**
   - Stop MySQL in Laragon
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Start MySQL again

2. **Check .env file:**
   - Make sure `DB_PASSWORD=` is empty (for Laragon default)

3. **Clear Python cache:**
   ```cmd
   del /s /q __pycache__
   ```

## Already Fixed in Code:
- âœ… Connection pooling enabled
- âœ… Auto-reconnect (pool_pre_ping)
- âœ… Connection error handling
- âœ… Retry logic for failed queries

The app should now handle connection drops automatically!
